Why is diversity important to DBC?
* Being able to recognize, appreciate and incorporate not only the similarities but the differences that exist within and between people is fundamentally valuable to Dev Bootcamp. 
* Dev Bootcamp is a bridge between those who strive for a career as a professional web developer and those professional opportunities. In this position, we want to be able to instill a powerful belief in diversity in the mindsets of all Dev Bootcamp students while also increasing the number of diverse students that attend Dev Bootcamp. 

How do we think about diversity?
* We believe that diversity is an integral part of the Dev Bootcamp ethos - diversity makes all of us better people and software developers
* Diversity is not merely the pursuit of the idea of equal access to software development, it’s an attempt to redefine the profession itself
* We believe that diversity is both visible and invisible. We often conceive of diversity in terms of the visible differences (e.g. age, race, gender, physical stature) and ignore the invisible aspects of diversity (work/life experience, sexual orientation, marital status, educational background, parental status, income, religious beliefs and affiliations, geographic location, or socioeconomic status.)
* We believe that diversity is by definition uncomfortable. True diversity ensures that someone in the room will have experiences, beliefs and values that run counter to yours. 

What is diversity not?
* We believe that diversity is not simply achieved through an increase in numbers (e.g. the Noah’s Ark approach to diversity.) Simply introducing more members of a minority group does not alter the fundamental beliefs of the larger group. 
* Diversity is not confined to a set of initiatives that by nature start and stop, rather it is an ongoing pursuit led by all representatives of Dev Bootcamp. Building a diverse student body and staff takes uniformity of purpose and consistent effort of all DBC representatives.

What do we expect of DBC staff and students regarding diversity
* To set and live by cultural norms centered around embracing the differences and discomfort that diversity will bring
* Acts against embracing of diversity cannot just threaten an individual in our community but needs to threaten us all
* To not assimilate all of our differences into a less threatening derivative, rather uphold our differences with respect

Our agenda
* Internally we will
 * develop, alongside current staff and students, those cultural norms, language, and resources that help us celebrate the importance of diversity while dealing with the day to day difficulties that arise from the differences
 * Thoroughly address the relationship between diversity and accessibility. While they are not mutually exclusive, there is a highly nuanced relationship between the two that requires a great deal of attention. 
 * Engrain the ethos of diversity in every person, circle and decision in DBC. If diversity lives on in initiatives started by the Diversity Stewards, we’ve lost. 
 * Integrate fully activities and support systems in our EE curriculum to help build comfort and confidence in talking about diversity and handling the discomfort. 
* For external audiences and partners, we will
 * create a set of documents that succinctly message our views on diversity
 * enable everyone interested in DBC to experience our views of diversity and culture, through:
  * interactions with students and staffs 
  * artifacts that enable potential employees, students, partners and interested people to experience diversity
 * work with marketing to promote our values of diversity to ALL populations, especially in the marketing and recruitment 
 * establish partnerships and/or scholarship fund that addresses issues of financial accessibility
